Command-Line Interface (CLI) for managing and purchasing products from a store.

## Description

This module provides a CLI for interacting with a `Store` object,
allowing users to view products, check total quantities, and place orders.
Products in the store can have different promotion types,
including "Second Half Price," "Third One Free,"
and percentage-based discounts.

## Usage:

Run the script to start the CLI, view products, and place orders. Example:

```shell
python main.py
```
